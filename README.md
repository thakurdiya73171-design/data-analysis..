📊 Student Score Data Analysis

A data analysis project focused on exploring student performance using statistical techniques and data-visualization methods. The goal of this project is to uncover insights from student score data, identify performance patterns, and build predictive models (optional) that can estimate student outcomes.

🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset containing student scores across different subjects and demographic variables.
Key tasks include:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualization of trends and patterns

Statistical insights and correlations

(Optional) Machine learning models to predict student scores
